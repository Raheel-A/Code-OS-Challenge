# Virtex Online Services Code Challenge

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Make sure that you are using Unreal 4.27.2 or above
* It's a more a code test so be sure that you have VisualStudio, Rider or NotePad++

### Getting project

Create a Fork of this project with your github account. If you don't have one or you want to just clone the project it's also fine, just remember to put it on WeTransfer or your GDrive afterwards. After finishing it, please share it with [Kirill](mailto:kirill@virtexstadium.com)

## The Problem

Class USocialSubsystem is not fully implemented. Its purpose is to provide a basic interface to the UI for getting a friendlist and reacting on its changes

## The Goal

The goal is to complete USocialSubsystem implementation.
Subsystem itself is spread across files:
* Source/VirtexOSCode/Public/SocialSubsystemTypes.h
* Source/VirtexOSCode/Public/SocialSubsystem.h
* Source/VirtexOSCode/Private/SocialSubsystem.cpp

Ideally all changes should be done only to those files.

UI is already created and just waiting for subsystem to start working properly.

More info can be found in the SocialSubsystem.h file

## Requirements

Challenge doesnt require you to edit any blueprints and should be done completely in code.

Example of how finished work should look like:
